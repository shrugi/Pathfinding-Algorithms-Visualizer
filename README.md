## Meet the Algorithms

### Depth-First-Search (DFS)
Traverses the graph depth-first, exploring as far as possible before backtracking.

### Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
Explores the graph level by level, visiting all neighbors before moving on to the next level.

### A* using Manhattan Distance h(n)
Heuristic-based algorithm combining Dijkstra's and greedy search, utilizing Manhattan distance as a heuristic.

### Dijkstra (Uniform-Cost-Search variant)
Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph using a priority queue for lower-cost paths.

### Greedy-Best-First Search using Manhattan Distance
Greedy algorithm prioritizing paths based on Manhattan distance to the goal.

### Bidirectional Search
Simultaneously explores from both start and end points, meeting in the middle using A* algorithm.

- **Astar:** Bidirectional exploration using A* algorithm.
- **BFS:** Bidirectional Breadth-First-Search, meeting in the middle.
- **Greedy-BFS:** Bidirectional Greedy-Best-First Search with a greedy heuristic.
- **Dijkstra (UCS):** Bidirectional Dijkstra to find the shortest path.

### Random Maze Generation Algorithms

- **Prim's Algorithm:** Generates a maze by adding random edges following Prim's algorithm.
- **Recursive Backtracker:** Uses recursive backtracking to create a maze.

### Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms

- **Prim's Algorithm:** Finds the minimum spanning tree in a weighted, connected graph.

### Topological Sorting

- **Kahn's Algorithm:** Orders nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) linearly based on dependencies.
